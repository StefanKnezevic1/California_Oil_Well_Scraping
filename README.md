# Scraping-California-Oil-Well-Info
This was my first coding project. Throughout this process I familiarized myself with Python and learned about different libraries available to me. I used Selenium webdriver and the CSV library to scan through API numbers for oil wells, scrape the relevant data from those websites and write it all into a concise excel document. The CSV file attached to this repository is a snippet of the generated data. Teh full dataset has ~100k records and is too big to upload to GitHub.
